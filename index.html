    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <p>
      The <b>HyperText Markup Language</b> or <b>HTML</b> is the standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">markup language</a> for documents designed to be displayed in a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">web browser. </a>It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as
      JavaScript.
    </p>

    <p>
      Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.

    <h2>Sejarah</h2>
    <h3>Development</h3>
    <p>
      In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[3]
      Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally
      adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.[4]

    <h3>HTML version timeline</h3>
    <h4>HTML 2</h4>
    <h4>November 24, 1995</h4>
    <p>HTML 2.0 was published as RFC 1866. Supplemental RFCs added capabilities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        November 25, 1995: RFC 1867 (form-based file upload)
        <ul>
          <li>
            Sub List 1
            <ol>
              <li>1</li>
              <li>2</li>
              <li>3</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Sub List 2</li>
          <li>Sub List 3</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>May 1996: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments">RFC </a>1942 (tables)</li>
      <li>August 1996: RFC 1980 (client-side image maps)</li>
      <li>January 1997: RFC 2070 (internationalization)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>HTML 3</h4>
    <h4>January 14, 1997</h4>
    <p>HTML 3.2[15] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It was the first version developed and standardized exclusively by the W3C, as the IETF had closed its HTML Working Group on September 12, 1996.[16]</p>
    <p>
      Initially code-named "Wilbur",[17] HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted most of Netscape's visual markup tags. Netscape's blink element and Microsoft's marquee
      element were omitted due to a mutual agreement between the two companies.[13] A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that of HTML was standardized 14 months later in MathML.

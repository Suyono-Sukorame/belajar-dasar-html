  The <b>HyperText Markup Language</b> or <b>HTML</b> is the standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">markup language</a> for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web
  content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
</p>

<p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</p>

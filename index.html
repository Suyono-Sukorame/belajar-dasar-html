<h1>HTML</h1>
<p>
  The <b>HyperText Markup Language</b> or <b>HTML</b> is the standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">markup language</a> for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web
  content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
</p>

<p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</p>

<h2>Sejarah</h2>
<h3>Development</h3>
<p>
  In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[3]
  Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted
  by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.[4]
